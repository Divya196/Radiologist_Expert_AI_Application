# Radiologist Expert: Gemini Pro Vision LLM

## Project Overview

Recently, my mom met with an accident, and during the course of her treatment, I found myself waiting for a long time to meet the doctor after taking a CT scan. In the meantime, as a biology student in my 10th standard who pursued information technology for my bachelor's, my family members began sharing the scan report with me, seeking a second opinion as if I were an expert.

This experience inspired me to create an application using Google Generative AI, specifically the **Gemini Pro Vision**, resulting in the development of the Radiology Expert application. The purpose of this app is to facilitate the understanding of scan images, enabling users to ask questions and receive AI-driven analysis.

## Objectives

- Provide an intuitive tool for diagnosis.
- Leverage advanced AI technology for analyzing and providing feedback on scan images.
- Offer a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process.

## Features

- **Scan Image Upload:** Users can upload their medical imaging in JPEG, JPG, or PNG formats.
- **Any Questions:** A text input field allows users to ask questions, providing access to a Radiologist expert.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizing Gemini AI, the application provides a detailed analysis of the scan image in the context of the questions asked.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** For creating the web application interface.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro Vision):** For processing and analyzing the image content.
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **PDF2Image & PIL:** For handling PDF file conversions and image processing.

## Challenges Faced

- **Integration with Gemini AI:** Ensuring seamless communication between the Streamlit interface and Gemini AI model.
- **User Experience Optimization:** Creating an intuitive and responsive UI.

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for Multiple Scan Images:** Extend the functionality to handle multiple images.
- **Customizable Feedback Categories:** Allow users to choose specific areas for feedback.
- **Interactive Conversation:** Integrate a feature to interact directly based on the AI's suggestions.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improve the system's robustness in handling various file formats and user inputs.

## Conclusion

The Radiologist Expert Streamlit application stands as a significant tool in bridging the gap. By harnessing the power of AI, it provides valuable insights and recommendations, making it a pivotal step in enhancing the understanding process.
