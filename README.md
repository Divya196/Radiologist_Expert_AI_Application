###Extractor Expert: Gemini Pro Vision LLM

Project Overview

Recently my mom met with an accident,we took CT Scan for her and waiting for long time to meet the doctor,untill that i was searching google for each terminologies mentioned in report as I'm a biology student in my 10th standard but pursed information technology as my bachelors,so my family members will share report and ask me the second opinion as like i'm an expert.....So i took this as a idea to my project, I created an application using Google generative AI [GEMINI PRO VISION] and built an application . Usually We'll get the scan report from the centre and consult doctor accordingly based on their availability... So to make ease of this process, I built an application called Radiology Expert which answer about the scan image .
